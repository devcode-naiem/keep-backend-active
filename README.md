# Keep Backend Active

A GitHub Actions workflow to ensure your backend remains active by periodically pinging it. This solution is free, lightweight, and fully integrated into your codebase, eliminating the need for third-party services or external monitoring tools. It ensures that free-tier backends (like Render or Heroku) do not go idle due to inactivity, improving response times for users.

## üöÄ Why Use This Workflow?

### **Key Benefits**
- **Free to Use**: Leverages GitHub Actions, which is free for public repositories and includes a generous free tier for private ones.
- **No Third-Party Services**: No need for additional services like UptimeRobot or external cron jobs. Everything is self-contained in your repository.
- **Customizable**: Fully configurable workflow, allowing you to adjust the ping frequency, logging, and failure handling to suit your needs.
- **Professional-Grade**: Includes retry logic, robust error handling, and instant notifications via GitHub‚Äôs built-in email alerts.
- **Open Source**: You can clone, copy, or adapt this workflow for your own projects.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### **Core Features**
1. **Scheduled Pings**:
   - Sends periodic requests to your backend to prevent it from going idle.
   - Configured to run every 5 minutes by default (adjustable via a cron job).

2. **Retry Logic**:
   - Automatically retries ping requests if the backend does not respond as expected.

3. **Failure Handling**:
   - Logs detailed error messages.
   - Sends email notifications via GitHub if the backend is unresponsive.

4. **Customizable Environment Variables**:
   - Easily update the backend URL and other parameters without modifying the workflow file.

5. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Tracks response times, HTTP status codes, and other metrics.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Setup Instructions

### **1. Clone or Copy the Repository**
You can either clone this repository or copy the workflow file into your existing project.

#### Clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devcode-naiem/keep-backend-active.git
```

#### Copy the Workflow File:
1. Navigate to `.github/workflows/keep-backend-active.yml` in this repository.
2. Copy the file into the `.github/workflows/` directory of your project.

---

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**
1. Go to your repository‚Äôs **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
2. Add a new secret:
   - **Name**: `BACKEND_API_URL`
   - **Value**: Your backend‚Äôs health check endpoint (e.g., `https://your-backend.com/api/health`).

---

### **3. Customize the Workflow**
- Adjust the cron schedule in the workflow file (`*/5 * * * *` for every 5 minutes).
- Update retry logic, notification methods, or add integrations (Slack, Discord, etc.) as needed.

---

### **4. Monitor Workflow Execution**
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
- Check the logs of the workflow runs for successful pings or failure details.

---

## üìå Example Use Cases

- **Prevent Free-Tier Backends from Going Idle**: Avoid delays caused by "cold starts" on platforms like Render, Heroku, or Vercel.
- **Monitor Backend Health**: Ensure your backend responds as expected and receive instant failure notifications.
- **Simplify Operations**: Eliminate dependency on third-party uptime services.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features

### **1. Retry Logic**
- Automatically retries failed requests to avoid false negatives.

### **2. Instant Notifications**
- Uses GitHub‚Äôs built-in email notifications for failures.

### **3. Metrics Tracking**
- Logs response times and HTTP status codes for debugging and optimization.

          echo "Received HTTP status code: $RESPONSE"
          if [ "$RESPONSE" -ne "$EXPECTED_STATUS_CODE" ]; then
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Log Success
